						Global warming is expected to lead to a more vigorous hydrological cycle, 
						including more total rainfall and more frequent high intensity rainfall events. 
						Rainfall amounts and intensities increased on average in the United States during 
						the 20th century and, according to climate change models, they are expected to 
						continue to increase during the 21st century. These rainfall changes, along with 
						expected changes in temperature, solar radiation, and atmospheric CO2 
						concentrations, will have significant impacts on soil erosion rates. The 
						processes involved in the impact of climate change on soil erosion by water are 
						complex, involving changes in rainfall amounts and intensities, number of days of 
						precipitation, ratio of rain to snow, plant biomass production, plant residue 
						decomposition rates, soil microbial activity, evapo-transpiration rates, and 
						shifts in land use necessary to accommodate a new climatic regime. WEPPCAT 
						is a web-based erosion simulation tool that allows for the assessment of changes 
						in erosion rates as a consequence of user-defined climate change scenarios. 
						This tool is based on the USDA-ARS Water Erosion Prediction Project (WEPP) 
						erosion model. It has the capability of taking into account all of the 
						erosion-affecting processes listed above.
					</p>
					<p>
						To work with WEPPCAT, run the Baseline Conditions first by selecting the 
						inputs on the left and pressing the “Run Baseline Conditions” button. When 
						the simulation is complete this area will contain a brief summary of the 
						results. To view more detailed outputs from the model, as well as the input 
						files used, click on the link for the main WEPP output summary file at the 
						bottom of the results page. 
					</p>
					<p>
						After the baseline Conditions are run, you can simulate different scenarios 
						by selecting new inputs and modifying climate under the "Assess Changes" 
						section on the left. Within the "Assess Changes" section of the program, 
						you can also compare the outputs from the different scenarios by pushing 
						the "Compare" button under the "Assess Change" pull-down menu. 
					</p>
					<p>
						The "Assess Filter Strip" pull-down menu allows the user to compute a 
						new filter strip width under the changed climate scenario that has the 
						same level of effectiveness (in terms of sediment yield) as did the original 
						filter strip width under the original climate. 
					</p>
					<p>
						If you want start from the beginning, push the "Start Over" button, 
						thereby erasing all the old work. 
					</p>
					<p>
						The WEPPCAT tool contains a new capability within "Modify Climate" Section 
						of the program that allows the user to "Intensify Rainfall". Current 
						understanding of trends in global climate change have indicated that 
						not only are rainfall amounts increasing, but the amount of rain falling 
						in high intensity events is also on the rise in many parts of the world. 
						To our knowledge this is the first tool that allows one to assess the 
						effects of rainfall intensification on soil erosion rates.
