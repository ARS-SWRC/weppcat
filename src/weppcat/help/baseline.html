				<p>
					The purpose of this section of the tool is to run an erosion assessment 
					for current, or "baseline", climate conditions.  This part of the tool works 
					similarly to the current on-line version of the WEPP model (currently housed 
					at the USDA-ARS National Soil Erosion Research Laboratory in West Lafayette, IN).  
					The use must run the "Baseline Conditions" portion of the tool prior to making 
					any modification to climate input for the model.   
				</p> 
				<p>
				  User must select the state of interest, after which the desired climate 
				  station and soil must be selected from the pull-down menus.  The user must 
				  also enter information regarding the length, width, shape, and gradient of the 
				  slope.  Note that the scale of application is relatively short.  Field lengths 
				  should not exceed approximately 300 ft. for relatively accurate erosion predictions.
				</p>
				<p>
				  The user also has the option of entering information on a filter strip to be 
				  located at the bottom end of the slope, as well as the management selection 
				  for the filter strip.  Generally speaking, a filter strip is used to trap 
				  sediment eroded from the upper portion of the hillslope to reduce off-site 
				  sediment yields from the field. 
				</p>
				<p>
					When all fields are entered, the user will press the "Run Baseline 
					Conditions" button.  Baseline conditions should only be run once without 
					"starting over".
