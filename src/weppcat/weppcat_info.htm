<h2 align="center">Welcome to the WEPPCAT Simulation </h2>
<p>
	Global warming is expected to lead to a more vigorous hydrological cycle, including more 
	total rainfall and more frequent high intensity rainfall events.  Rainfall amounts and 
	intensities increased on average in the United States during the 20th century and, according 
	to climate change models, they are expected to continue to increase during the 21st century.  
	These rainfall changes, along with expected changes in temperature, solar radiation, and 
	atmospheric CO2 concentrations, will have significant impacts on soil erosion rates.  
	The processes involved in the impact of climate change on soil erosion by water are complex, 
	involving changes in rainfall amounts and intensities, number of days of precipitation, 
	ratio of rain to snow, plant biomass production, plant residue decomposition rates, 
	soil microbial activity, evapo-transpiration rates, and shifts in land use necessary to 
	accommodate a new climatic regime.  WEPPCAT is a web-based erosion simulation tool that 
	allows for the assessment of changes in erosion rates as a consequence of user-defined 
	climate change scenarios.  This tool is based on the USDA-ARS Water Erosion Prediction 
	Project (WEPP) erosion model.  It has the capability of taking into account all of the 
	erosion-affecting processes listed above.

   To work with WEPPCAT, run the Baseline Conditions first by selecting the inputs on 
   the left and pressing the “Run Baseline Conditions” button. When the simulation is 
   complete this area will contain a brief summary of the results. To view more detailed 
   outputs from the model, as well as the input files used, click on the link for the 
   main WEPP output summary file at the bottom of the results page.
</p>
<p>
   After the baseline Conditions are run, you can simulate different scenarios by 
   selecting new inputs and modifying climate under the "Assess Changes" section on 
   the left.  Within the "Assess Changes" section of the program, you can also compare 
   the outputs from the different scenarios by pushing the "Compare" button under the 
   "Assess Change" pull-down menu.
</p>
<p>
   The "Assess Filter Strip" pull-down menu allows the user to compute a new filter 
   strip width under the changed climate scenario that has the same level of 
   effectiveness (in terms of sediment yield) as did the original filter strip 
   width under the original climate.
</p>
<p>
   If you want start from the beginning, push the "Start Over" button, thereby erasing
   all the old work.
</p>
<p>
	The WEPPCAT tool contains a new capability within "Modify Climate" Section of the 
	program that allows the user to "Intensify Rainfall".  Current understanding of 
	trends in global climate change have indicated that not only are rainfall amounts 
	increasing, but the amount of rain falling in high intensity events is also on 
	the rise in many parts of the world.   To our knowledge this is the first tool that 
	allows one to assess the effects of rainfall intensification on soil erosion rates.
